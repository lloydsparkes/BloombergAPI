# BLPAPI Testing Support

`Bloomberglp.Blpapi.Test.TestUtil` provides users with ability to
test their applications offline through the creation of custom events for
their applications.

We are providing in this solution:
- A simple application `MktNotifierApp` complete with tests.
- A simple `ResolverLib` implementation complete with tests.
- Some unit tests which demonstrate the construction of some common messages
  and events.
